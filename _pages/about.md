<font color="purple"> **DLAGen** v0.5 has been released! [Check out](https://github.com/CMU-VLSI/dlagen) our hardware generator tool for deep learning accelerators! Full release coming up soon!</font>

I am a 5th year PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Prof. Ken Mai](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/mai-ken.html). I’m a computer architect and a chip-building VLSI engineer with sub-28nm tapeout experiences. My research interests are in the design of domain-specific accelerators for emerging applications such as deep learning and robotics. I’m especially interested in designing flexible and future-proof accelerators that are ready for workloads of the future.

Prior to CMU, I graduated from Duke University with my BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering. During my undergrad I worked with [Prof. Krishnendu Chakrabarty](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krishnendu-chakrabarty-2521186) on hardware security.
